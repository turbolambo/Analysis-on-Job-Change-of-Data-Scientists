# Analysis-on-Job-Change-of-Data-Scientists

This is a student project for machine learning class, done in a team of 3.

With the field of analytics continually expanding, many companies have developed courses to prepare aspiring data scientists. One organization in particular, provides this training with the hope that those who successfully complete the course will become a qualified candidate for their company. To determine the probability that a person is searching for a new job and to better understand their employment decisions, we evaluated several different factors.


We conducted an initial analysis of the data to remove unrelated variables, observe the relationships between the remaining variables and to note interesting findings. After cleaning and processing the data, we first predicted the target variable using logistic regression and then compared that with a random forest model. Prediction accuracy was the highest when using random forest, however, logistic regression also provided some helpful insights. Our analysis concluded that the level of development in which a candidate resides, their education level, and the number of training hours are the most influential in their decisions and in determining how likely it is that they would join the company. This information, combined with our prediction models, will help the company better understand candidatesâ€™ motivations and make more informed decisions regarding the training courses they provide.
